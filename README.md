One more try at writting a virtual machine... 
Project is still very recent and code is slightly hammered..


[Here](Operations.md) is a list of the current supported opperations


## Example

Using [example.cas](tests/example.cas) as an example:

First, assemble the text file into an object file

>./a.out example.cas example.o

Then, run the file

>./a.out example.o

Output:

>60
